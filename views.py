def create_views(db_connector: Connection, cursor: Cursor) -> None:
    r"""
    Create database views to simplify queries and improve data retrieval efficiency.

    This function generates **SQL views**, which are stored queries that allow efficient 
    access to faculty information, campus departments, and campus buildings.

    Views Created
    =============
    1. **``faculty_view``**: Combines faculty details with their additional info.
       - **Columns**: All columns from `faculties` and `faculty_info`.
    
    2. **``campus_departments``**: Lists departments available at each campus.
       - **Columns**: `campus_id`, `department`

    3. **``campus_buildings``**: Lists buildings available at each campus.
       - **Columns**: `campus_id`, `building_id`

    Parameters
    ==========
    - **db_connector** : Connection
      The database connection object used to interact with the database.
    
    - **cursor** : Cursor
      A cursor object for executing SQL commands.

    Examples
    =========
    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from SASTRA import *

		>>> # Create Connection object and Cursor object
        >>> connector, cursor = connect(
				user="root",
				password="secret_pwd",
				host="localhost"
			)
        
		>>> create_database(connector, cursor)
		>>> create_relations(connector, cursor)
		>>> create_timetable(connector, cursor)
        >>> create_views(connector, cursor)
